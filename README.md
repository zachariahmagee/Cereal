# Cereal PLOTTER

This application was originally built using Processing-Java, with a custom UI and plotting library (PenGUIn). This version is revamped using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. 

Status: In-Progress

Goals:
  - Create a multi-platform (MacOS and Windows) stand-alone serial plotting application, similar to the built-in Arduino IDE serial plotter with additional functionality.
  - Provide high quality, glitch free, customizable serial plotting on both Cartesian and Polar plots.
  - Multiple traces/ multiple plots
  - Plot Types: 
    - Cartesian with user-defined y values and auto-incrementing x values
    - Scatter (user-defined x and y)
    - Polar
  - Customizable plots via serial commands and through an intuitive user interface
  - Various display modes including spectrogram and persistence
  - Live markers and peak finding
  - Record to CSV
  - In-app screen capture and screenshots
  - A fully explanatory user manual with extensive examples
